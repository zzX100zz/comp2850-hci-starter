## Visual Observation (Broken Image)
- **09:41:40**: While looking at the list, P1 pointed to the small icon above the task list.
- **Critical Observation**: The image failed to load and showed the source code.
- **Quote**: "**Why is there no image here? It looks broken.** Is that supposed to be a logo?"
- **Note**: I checked the source code later. It was a syntax error (`< img` with a space) causing the browser to ignore the tag or fail rendering.
