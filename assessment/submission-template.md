## Privacy & Ethics Statement

- [ ] I confirm all participant data is anonymous (session IDs use P1_xxxx format, not real names)
- [ ] I confirm all screenshots are cropped/blurred to remove PII (no names, emails, student IDs visible)
- [ ] I confirm all participants gave informed consent
- [ ] I confirm this work is my own (AI tools used for code assistance are cited below)

**AI tools used** (if any): [e.g., "Copilot for route handler boilerplate (lines 45-67 in diffs)"]

## 1. Protocol & Tasks

### Link to Needs-Finding (LO2)

**Week 6 Job Story #1**:
> When I remember a deadline while listening to a lecture, I want to add a task quickly, so I can review it later, because I will forget it if I don't write it down immediately.

**How Task 1 tests this**:
> Task 1 (Add Task) directly tests this story by measuring if a user can successfully capture a new task ("Buy milk") within a short timeframe (<10s).

**Week 6 Job Story #2**:
> When I have finished an assignment, I want to remove it from my list, so I can focus on what is left, because a cluttered list makes me feel anxious.

**How Task 3 tests this**:
> Task 3 (Delete Task) tests this story by verifying if the user can easily locate and remove a completed item to declutter their view.

**Week 6 Job Story #3**:
When I have a long list of accumulated tasks and deadlines, I want to quickly find a specific task (like "Submit Portfolio"), so I can check its status or mark it as complete without scrolling endlessly, because searching through a cluttered list causes me anxiety and wastes my time.

**How Task 2 tests this**:
Task 2 (Find Task) tests this by measuring if the user can locate a specific item within the target time (< 5 seconds) using visual scanning or filter features, verifying the interface scales well with content.

**Week 6 Job Story #4**:
When I am using an old library computer or a secure terminal where JavaScript is disabled for security, I want to still be able to add and view my tasks, so I can capture important to-dos immediately regardless of the device I am using, because I cannot rely on always having my personal smartphone or laptop with me.

**How Task 4 tests this**:
Task 4 (No-JS Fallback) tests this by verifying that core functions (Add/Delete) remain operational via server-side rendering (POST-Redirect-GET pattern) when client-side scripting is unavailable.

### Part B: Before/After Comparison

**Instructions**: Compare Week 9 baseline (pre-fix) to Week 10 (post-fix). Show improvement.

| Metric | Before (Week 9, n=X) | After (Week 10, n=Y) | Change | Target Met? |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|--------|-------------|
| SR error detection | [e.g., 0/2 (0%)] | [e.g., 2/2 (100%)] | [e.g., +100%] | [✅/❌] |
| Validation error rate | [e.g., 33%] | [e.g., 0%] | [e.g., -33%] | [✅/❌] |
| Median time [Task X] | [e.g., 1400ms] | [e.g., 1150ms] | [e.g., -250ms] | [✅/❌] |
| WCAG [criterion] pass | [fail] | [pass] | [— ] | [✅/❌] |

**Re-pilot details**:
- **P5** (post-fix): [Variant - e.g., "Screen reader user, NVDA + keyboard"] - [Date piloted]
- **P6** (if applicable): [Variant] - [Date]

**Limitations / Honest reporting**:
[If metrics didn't improve or only modestly: explain why. Small sample size? Wrong fix? Needs more iteration? Be honest - valued over perfect results.]

## 6. Evidence Folder Contents

**Instructions**: List all files in your evidence/ folder. Provide context.

### Screenshots

| Filename | What it shows | Context/Link to finding |
|----------|---------------|-------------------------|
| before-sr-error.png | Error message without role="alert" | Finding #1 - SR errors not announced |
| after-sr-error.png | Error message WITH role="alert" added | Fix #1 verification |
| regression-axe-report.png | axe DevTools showing 0 violations | Verification Part A |
| [your-screenshot-3.png] | [Description] | [Which finding/fix this supports] |

**PII check**:
- [ ] All screenshots cropped to show only relevant UI
- [ ] Browser bookmarks/tabs not visible
- [ ] Participant names/emails blurred or not visible

---

### Pilot Notes

**Instructions**: Attach pilot notes as separate files (P1-notes.md, P2-notes.md, etc.). Summarize key observations here.

**P1** ([ Variant - e.g., "Standard mouse + HTMX"]):
- **Key observation 1**: [Quote + timestamp - e.g., "Struggled with filter button (09:47)"]
- **Key observation 2**: [Quote + timestamp]

**P2** ([Variant]):
- **Key observation 1**: [Quote + timestamp]
- **Key observation 2**: [Quote + timestamp]

[Repeat for P3, P4 if applicable]

## Evidence Chain Example (Full Trace)

**Instructions**: Pick ONE finding and show complete evidence trail from data → fix → verification.

**Finding selected**: [e.g., "Finding #1 - SR errors not announced"]

**Evidence trail**:
1. **Data**: metrics.csv lines 47-49 show P2 (SR user) triggered validation_error 3 times
2. **Observation**: P2 pilot notes timestamp 14:23 - Quote: "I don't know if it worked, didn't hear anything"
3. **Screenshot**: before-sr-error.png shows error message has no role="alert" or aria-live
4. **WCAG**: 3.3.1 Error Identification (Level A) violation - errors not programmatically announced
5. **Prioritisation**: findings-table.csv row 1 - Priority score 7 (Impact 5 + Inclusion 5 - Effort 3)
6. **Fix**: implementation-diffs.md Fix #1 - Added role="alert" + aria-live="assertive" to error span
7. **Verification**: verification.csv Part A row F2 - 3.3.1 now PASS (tested with NVDA)
8. **Before/after**: verification.csv Part B - SR error detection improved from 0% to 100%
9. **Re-pilot**: P5 (SR user) pilot notes - "Heard error announcement immediately, corrected and succeeded"

**Complete chain**: Data → Observation → Interpretation → Fix → Verification ✅
